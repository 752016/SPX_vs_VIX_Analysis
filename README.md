# SPX_vs_VIX_Analysis
An analysis of the inverse relationship of the S&amp;P 500 Index ETF ($SPY) against VIX Futures

The VIX Index has often been referenced by financial analysts during times of market downturn as a “fear gauge”. Indeed, the index itself calculates a figure based on front and back month futures of the SPX futures contracts. Being weighted 2:1 in favor of put options, it stands to reason that a basket of such instruments would appreciate during times of market downturn and depreciate during times of market stability and growth. Yet still, I believe there are great misconceptions about the instrument itself that may be overlooked by new investors who may believe it to be a leveraged inverse ETF, as I used to do, but was proven incorrect through staggering losses from this misthinking. This analysis will further examine this unique and complex relationship between the instruments.

The main analysis document will be within the Analysis_Document folder, other folders include source files and pdfs of reports I made in Tableau and PowerBI.
